# Circular Objects Detection
This is an ImageJ plugin to process images of ![colored_balls](https://github.com/zheliu422/Circular-Objects-Detection/blob/master/colored_balls.png) and print out (to the log window) the answers to the following questions:
1.How many m&ms are in the image? 
2.What is the total area in pixels covered by each of the colors of m&ms?
