# Circular Objects Detection
This is an [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) plugin to process images of colored balls. Image below is the object waiting to be processes. ![colored_balls](https://github.com/zheliu422/Circular-Objects-Detection/blob/master/colored_balls.png) 
After the processing, it will print out (to the log window) the answers to the following questions:<br />
1.How many m&ms are in the image? <br />
2.What is the total area in pixels covered by each of the colors of m&ms?<br />
Also, in the implementation, I used the [IJ Blob](https://imagej.net/IJ_Blob) library. Credit to: Wagner, T and Lipinski, H 2013. IJBlob: An ImageJ Library for Connected Component Analysis and Shape Analysis. Journal of Open Research Software 1(1):e6, DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/jors.ae
