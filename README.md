# Circular Objects Detection
This is an [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) plugin to process images of colored balls. Image below is the object waiting to be processes. ![colored_balls](https://github.com/zheliu422/Circular-Objects-Detection/blob/master/colored_balls.png) 
After the processing, it will print out (to the log window) the answers to the following questions:<br />
1.How many m&ms are in the image? <br />
2.What is the total area in pixels covered by each of the colors of m&ms?<br />
